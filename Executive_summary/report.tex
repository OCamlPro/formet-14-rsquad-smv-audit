\section{Introduction}

This set of documents is a submission for the 14th contest of the
Formal Methods sub-governance, called ``Contest Proposal: SMV Smart
Contract Informal Audit Respin''.

The projects to be audited were:
\begin{itemize}
\item DENS-SMV Project, at \url{https://github.com/RSquad/dens-smv} at branch master with
  hash code equal to fbdfe4bca3c372b02cacf9788b4ad37112d0da2c
\item BFTG Project (SMV part only) at
  \url{https://github.com/RSquad/BFTG} (SMV part only) at branch
  master with hash code equal to
  7c6ec7d811bcc1f228a3499ab19f6d20652ca94b
\end{itemize}

The contest ended at Aug 20, 2021, 23:59:59 UTC.

This submission includes 3 documents:
\begin{itemize}
\item This executive summary
\item A detailed audit report for DENS-SMV project
\item A detailed audit report for BFTG project
\end{itemize}

Both detailed reports start with an index of major and critical
issues, with hyper-links to detailed explanations.

\section{Methodology}

The methodology used for this audit is the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Process all solidity files through an analyzer to generate a
  document with the code source ready for annotations
\item Read all the code source in the document, reporting any issue
  found in the code. For some issues, test whether the issue can
  happen on the testnet.
\item Following requests from jurors from previous audits, remove all
  functions without any interesting comments.
\end{enumerate}

Issues are sorted into 3 kinds:
\begin{itemize}
\item Critical issues: these issues could be used by a malicious user
  to steal tokens, or change the behavior of the service, making its
  results useless
\item Major issues: these issues can degrade the quality of the
  service
\item Minor issues: these issues have no real impact on the service,
  but could improve its development (for example, remarks on coding
  style, etc.)
\end{itemize}

We submitted some of the major and critical issues to the development
team (Roman @inyellowbus), but got no returns. 

We audited all the contracts of the 2 projects, though only the SMV
part of the BFTG project was required to be audited.

\section{Results}

\subsection{DENS-SMV Project}

We reported 6 critical issues, and 4 major issues in this project
(see the Table of Major and Critical Issues in the second page of the
corresponding report, with hyperlinks to the issues)

\subsection{BFTG Project}

We reported 15 critical issues, and 8 major issues in this project
(see the Table of Major and Critical Issues in the second page of the
corresponding report, with hyperlinks to the issues)
