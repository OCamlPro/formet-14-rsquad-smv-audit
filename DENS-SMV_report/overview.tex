\section{Architecture}

The project implements a system of voting for proposal with
soft-majority, where voting rights are represented as a TIP-3 token
(with a root token contract and wallets associated with each users).

The project contains the following contracts:

\begin{description}
\item[\bf Demiurge:] this contract is in charge of the deployment of {\tt Padawan}
contracts and {\tt Proposal} contracts. It acts as a central hub for
such interactions.
\item[\bf Proposal:] this contract corresponds to a proposal for which users
have to vote in a 7 days period, using their voting rights.
\item[\bf Padawan:] this contract belongs to a user that is expected to vote for
the different proposals. A wallet is associated with this contract to
hold the user's voting rights.
\item[\bf Faucet:] this contract is used to distribute the voting rights
to user and deploy their wallets.
\item[\bf DemiurgeStore:] this contract is in charge of storing the code
of all deployable contracts and shared addresses. It acts as a central
configuration for the infrastructure.
\item[\bf Base:] this contract is inherited by all other contracts and contains
constant definitions, and modifiers.
\item[\bf {\em Contract}Resolver:] these contracts are used to store the code of a
particular contract, and provide functions to compute the addresses of such
contracts and deploy them;
\end{description}

\section{Message Sequences}

\subsection{Vote}

\begin{itemize}
\item User sends a {\tt vote} message (from multisig) to his {\tt Padawan} contract to vote for a proposal
\item The {\tt Padawan} contract verifies that user has not yet used all his voting rights for this proposal, and sends a {\tt vote} message to the proposal
\item On reception of the {\tt vote} message, the {\tt Proposal} contract:
\begin{itemize}
\item checks whether the proposal is still ongoing or not
\item  sends a {\tt confirmVote} message or a {\tt rejectVote} message to the {\tt Padawan} contract
\item checks the result of the vote (if it is ended or if enough votes have been issued)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reclaim Deposits}

\begin{itemize}
\item User wants to recover some deposits for voting rights that are not currently used in a proposal, user sends a {\tt reclaimDeposit} message to his {\tt Padawan} contract
\item On reception of the {\tt reclaimDeposit} message, the {\tt Padawan} contract:
\begin{itemize}
\item Checks whether enough voting rights are ``free'', and can be sent back
\item Send a {\tt queryStatus} message to all active {\tt Proposal} contracts
\end{itemize}
\item On reception of a {\tt queryStatus} message, a {\tt Proposal} contract sends back an {\tt updateStatus} message to the {\tt Padawan} contract
\item On reception of the {\tt updateStatus} message, the {\tt Padawan} contract frees the votes for ended proposals. If enough voting rights are ``free'', the tokens are sent back by sending a {\tt transfer} message to the wallet contract
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Providing Voting Rights to a User}

\begin{itemize}
\item The administrator (owner of the {\tt Faucet} contract) sends a {\tt changeBalance} message to the {\tt Faucet} contract associating voting rights to a pubkey
\item The user sends a {\tt claimTokens} message to the {\tt Faucet} contract, providing the address of the wallet associated with his {\tt Padawan} contract
\item If the voting rights of the corresponding pubkey exists, the {\tt Faucet} contract sends a {\tt transfer} message to its wallet to transfer the tokens to the user's wallet
\item The user sends a {\tt depositTokens} message to his {\tt Padawan} contract
\item The {\tt Padawan} contracts sends a {\tt getBalance\_InternalOwner} message to its associated wallet
\item The wallet sends back a {\tt onGetBalance} message to the {\tt Padawan} contract with the updated voting rights of the user
\end{itemize}
