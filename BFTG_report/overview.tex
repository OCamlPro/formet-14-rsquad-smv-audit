\section{Architecture}

The architecture is mostly similar to the one detailed in the DENS-SMV
audit report, with only a few differences:

\begin{itemize}
\item The {\tt Demiurge} contract of DENS-SMV is called {\tt SmvRoot} contract
\item Voting can be restricted to a white list specified either directly or through a {\tt Group} contract
\item A {\tt Padawan} contract can manage multiple token wallets, so that the user may have different voting rights for different proposals
\end{itemize}
